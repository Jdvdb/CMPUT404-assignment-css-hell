=================
Changes:
I removed the default <style> tags within all of the books and replaced them
with <link rel="stylesheet" href="./books.css"> to use our styling.

Because all of the assets used similar names 'like' cover and are just in the
'images' directory, I created a new directory for each book's assets and updated
the html to grab assets from a folder given the same name as the .html file

=================
The 'good' version of my website was based off of an existing personal website
I have: https://vandenbruel.ca/

This is a simplified version that meets the project requirements, but it does
reuse many of the copy and some of the code I used from my personal site.
