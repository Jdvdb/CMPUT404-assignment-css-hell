                <h2>Who Are You Reading About?</h2>
                <p> My identity as a developer is as certain as a dice roll. I was pulled
                    into coding because it seemed like a tool with unlimited potential. Iâ€™ve
                    jumped around app and web development, machine learning, and data
                    science to see what computers are capable of. There is so much to learn
                    about in all of these fields and I don't know which would be the best
                    for me. So, I'm taking my time exploring each of them to decide which I
                    will make a career in.</p>
                <p> When I'm not developing, you'll usually see new activities being
                    uploaded to my Strava account. My usual activities are running and
                    cycling because I love seeing how far I can push myself to get a new
                    personal record. However, you'll occasionally see activities for
                    volleyball, swimming, snowboarding, and wake surfing! Most of my
                    remaining free time is spent learning and playing too many games of
                    chess. My favourite openings at the moment are the Vienna and Caro Kann!
                    Recently, I've also started to train for a sprint triathlon this summer.</p>

                <h2>What Have I Done?</h2>
                <p> I have worked as a teaching assistant with the University of Alberta
                    for 3 years now. My primary responsibilities here have been helping students
                    understand lecture material and debug their code for assignments when it doesn't work.
                    I also worked a 4 month internship at ATB Financial where I worked as a full stack
                    developer on their Brightside app. I developed new screens in React along with
                    unit and UI tests. My most recent work experience was a 12 month internship at Telus
                    where I primarily worked with bash scripts, NiFi and a SQL database to handle data that came
                    from voice switches.

                <h2>Why Would You Want To Hire Me?</h2>
                <p>Outside of my existing experience and technical abilities that I have learned through school
                    like most other applicants, I stand out from the rest because of the soft skills I have focused
                    on growing outside of classes. One of the most important of these being my ability to communicate.
                    I have gotten to hone this skill the most as a teaching assistant where I do my best to help students
                    that understand course concepts to varying degrees. One of the key things I've learned is that before
                    I can even begin trying to help a student, I have to listen to them first and try to understand where
                    their mind is at when facing a problem. From there, I can currate the way I offer feedback based on how
                    technically comfortable they are with the material. This skill has been invaluable for me and helped me
                    take on larger challenges like leading a cohort of interns at ATB for a capstone project.
